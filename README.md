# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be very abstract and full of a “perfect world” wish list.  A lot of times this isn’t feasible or cost effective.  Using user stories can help focus on the actual problems that need to be solved.  They simplify the definition of the requirements: As a [role] I want [to be able to do something] so that [benefit].

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I develop programs, I aways start on paper.  I can work out the problems, the requirements, and the thoughts prior to coding.  To do this, I need a clear picture of the requirements.  I hope to incorporate much of the agile planning process in my future development work.  Rolling wave planning, starting with a high-level plan to define the vision and scope, and define the particulars after requesting clarification would help set a solid foundation.  Also, creating user stories and maintaining a product backlog would help organize thoughts and tasks prior to beginning to develop a project.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
There are many ways to be good team member in software development, one must first and foremost pursue technical excellence.  That includes refactoring code, unit testing, and acceptance testing.  The development team must work together to refine the product backlog.  The backlog is the foundation of the product.  One must also criticize ideas, not people.  Experiences should be shared.  This helps the team gather knowledge and everyone can work on the tasks within the project.  A development team must also trust each other.  These are just a few examples.
