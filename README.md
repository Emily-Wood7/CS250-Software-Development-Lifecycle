# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be very abstract and full of a “perfect world” wish list.  A lot of times this isn’t feasible or cost effective.  Using user stories can help focus on the actual problems that need to be solved.  They simplify the definition of the requirements: As a [role] I want [to be able to do something] so that [benefit].

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
